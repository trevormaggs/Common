/**
 * Provides functionality to perform dynamic comparison operations between two operand values at
 * runtime using a strategy pattern. Supports various relational and pattern-matching operators.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Operators include equality, inequality, relational comparisons, regular expression matches, and
 * case-insensitive checks. This package encapsulates each operator as a separate strategy, allowing
 * flexible and extensible comparison logic.
